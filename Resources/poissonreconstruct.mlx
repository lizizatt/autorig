  <Param tooltip="This integer argument specifies the depth at which a block Gauss-Seidel solver is used to solve the Laplacian equation.&#xa;Using this parameter helps reduce the memory overhead at the cost of a small increase in reconstruction time. &#xa;In practice, the authors have found that for reconstructions of depth 9 or higher a subdivide depth of 7 or 8 can reduce the memory usage.&#xa;The default value is 8.&#xa;" description="Solver Divide" type="RichInt" value="6" name="SolverDivide"/>
  <Param tooltip="This floating point value specifies the minimum number of sample points that should fall within an octree node as the octree&#xa;construction is adapted to sampling density.
